# March Madness Bracket

It's Awesome Baby! A March Madness bracket written in Python supported by Redis, MySQL, and Docker. This repo is mainly for code portfolio purposes as the actual code repo is now private.

It's Awesome Baby came to life in 2010 as a passion project. Our mission was to simplify the process of making and submitting picks, setting us apart from other platforms. No need for cumbersome account creation, verification, or logins. Say goodbye to spam and marketing emails. With It's Awesome Baby, you can effortlessly make your picks and dive straight into the game. It's just that simple.
